# Burger Bistro 2 - The Sequel(ized)üçî
Burger Bistro 2 is a full-stack application that utilizes MYSQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize.

## Overview: 
Just like its predecessor the original Burger Bistro, Express-Handlebars is utilized to render HTML onto the page, and the MVC model for folder structure. Instead of using a homemade ORM, Sequelized is used instead to store and update the burger data for the client.

## Getting Started:

* For a live demo, please go to the following link: `https://polar-beyond-56526.herokuapp.com/burgers`
* To add burgers to the "Burgers Ready to be Eaten" column, please enter and submit your burger order.
* To eat the burger, click on "I want to try this one" button, and it will move to the "Burgers Devoured" column.
